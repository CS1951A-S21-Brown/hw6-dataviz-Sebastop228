        <h3><b>Questions about the dashboard</b></h3>
        <p>1. I chose to create my dashboard using the Football game dataset, "football.csv", with a graph to answer each of the required questions.<br>
            My first graph displays the number of games played each year over a five-year period: specifically, it does so in the 2010-2014 range.
            This a direct representation of my boss' request to see the number of football games per year.<br>
            My second graph allows my boss to visualize the 10 top winning nations, by displaying the top 10 teams with the highest win percentage over 75 games
            or more. This criteria was added to stop any skewing of the data from teams that have only played a very small number of games, with great success.
            A connected scatterplot allows to see the general decreasing trend of these top nations, and a user can hover over one of the dots to see the exact
            percentage.<br>
            The third graph is actually comprised of two, as we have taken two approaches to identifying the top performing nations over the last two world cups.
            The first method is to display the top 10 teams by goal differential (goals scored - goals scored against) over this period, in order to see the teams with the best performing
            attacks and defences. The second is to see display the top 10 teams by win percentage over this period. We notice a significant overlap between the top 10
            teams observed with both methods, allowing us to conclude we've satisfyingly answered our boss' question.<br><br>

            2. D3 was helpful and improved my visualizations in the following 3 ways: first, it allows for a wide range of options in the ways to manipulate the data and 
            in the possible representations we can display. Second, it allows for interactivity - which most other methods of data representation do not - which can be 
            a very effective way to get an audience enthused about your visualizations. Third, D3 is compatible with HTML, making it easy to embed visualizations in web pages,
            which is important in today's internet-heavy society.<br><br>

            3. D3 is NOT always the best tool for visualizations for the following three reasons: first, it can be time-consuming and difficult to generate visualizations with,
            which can make other tools, such as excel, a much more attractive option for most graphs. Second, it requires somewhat extensive coding knowledge, specifically of javascript
            and HTML, making it a rather inaccesible method of data visualization. Third, it requires the data to be entered in a format it can be read in and manipulated, such
            as a csv file, which is not always the case.
        <h3><b>Accessible Data Visualization</b></h3>
        </p>4. While many - if not most - users would find my dashboard accessible, some may have more difficulty with it. The "Accessible Data Visualization" reading
            mentions three 4 types of color blindness, all centered around the color green. As I'd chosen to make my graphs green - so it would evoke a football pitch and
            follow the theme of the data - I may have inadvertantly made my dashboard inaccesible to some. My titles are descriptive of what my graphs are displaying, and thus
            a visually-impaired user with a text-to-speech software would still be able to know what it is I'm representing. However, they'd be unable to know what the conclusions 
            of the data are; thus, still going off the "Accessible Data Visualization", a summary attached to each draft in which I explain the conclusions to be drawn from it would
            allow for users using these text-to-speech software to get a fuller experience from my dashboard. Similarly, adding an alt text would be useful. Despite these flaws,
            I believe the rest of my dashboard is descriptive enough to provide a full experience for most users.<br><br>

            5. An important stage I could have made my dashboard more accessible was when I was choosing the color of my graphs. I chose green to follow the theme of soccer, hoping it would
            evoke a soccer pitch. I didn't think it would be a difficult color for people with visual impairments, and this lack of thought stopped me from taking the step to making my 
            dashboard more accessible. Additionally, once I'd completed my graph, factors such as exhaustion and feeling burnt out stopped me from taking the extra steps of adding alt text 
            and graph summaries.
